// Edit this placeholder text as necessary to describe the deployment options.

This Quick Start provides the following deployment options:

* http://qs_launch_permalink[Deploy RHEL with HA APN into a new VPC^]. This option builds a new AWS environment that consists of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys RHEL with HA APN into this new VPC.
* http://qs_launch_permalink[Deploy RHEL with HA APN into an existing VPC^]. This option provisions RHEL with HA APN in your existing AWS infrastructure.

This Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and RHEL with HA APN settings.
