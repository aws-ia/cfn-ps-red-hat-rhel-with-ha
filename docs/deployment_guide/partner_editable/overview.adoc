High Availability for a service focuses on ensuring the system can operate with the best performance even when part of the system fails.  
Availability refers to the percentage of time that the infrastructure, system, or solution remains operational under normal circumstances in order to serve its intended purpose. High availability refers to the ability to avoid unplanned outages by eliminating single-point-of-failure (SPOF). 
The amount of “nines” is often used to indicate high availability, for example, Amazon EC2 Single-AZ Data Plane has 99,95% (3 nines) of Availability while Amazon EC2 Multi-AZ Data Plane has 99,99% (4 nines) of Availability.
