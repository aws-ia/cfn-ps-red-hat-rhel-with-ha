.RHEL with HA Partner Solution architecture: 3 availability zones, redundant bastion hosts
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/cfn-ps-red-hat-rhel-with-ha-architecture-diagram.png[Architecture]

This solution sets up the following:

* A high available RHEL HA cluster on AWS that spans across multiple Availability Zones.
* (Optional) A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets.
* In the public subnets:
** (Optional) A managed network address translation (NAT) gateway. This allows outbound internet access for resources in the private subnet.
** Redundant Linux bastion hosts in an Auto Scaling group. They allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in public and private subnets.
* In the private subnets:
** RHEL HA cluster nodes on EC2.
** (Optional) Routing tables used by the public and private subnets.
*** The RHEL HA cluster updates the routing when then Overlay IP address moves to another node.
** (Optional) A Internet gateway to provide internet access to instances in the public subnets.

[.small]#The solution can be customized (e.g. amount of cluster nodes / availability zones) and provides options to deploy into an existing or a new VPC.#
